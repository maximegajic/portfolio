                <h2>Application for micro-mobilities <span class="tech-stack">React Native</span> </h2>
                <p>During my formation, I had the opportunity to develop an application. Our group was separated in two smaller groups : one for the back-end and one for the front-end. I was in the front-end one. We had to code in React Native and it was a new language for all of us. The goal of the application was to find a path from a place to another one, based on several criteria such as security, time… So we had to create a user interface for that purpose. This project was my first interface, and he helped me get to grips with design development</p>

                <p>As projects during my formation, I created two autonomous players, one of go and another of the Amazon board game. The first was in Python and the other in C. Both included alpha-beta approaches and a board heuristic as a strategy. Other techniques, such as opening libraries, were also used. These projects gave me a first idea of the techniques used for artificial intelligence and allowed me to practice on them</p>

                <p>I was able to code a stand-alone board game in C. The two players were predefined, and the aim of the project was to make the game more complex by adding rules. This could range from new pieces with different moves to capturing pieces, or different game boards. This allowed me to get to grips with C and practice on a project. It was also a good example for the use of header</p>

                <p>CThis project, carried out during my training, involved creating and maintaining a database. The subject was school carpooling. All kinds of data had to be stored (proposed journeys, past journeys, etc.). We also had to check that the proposed journeys were coherent, and finally provide carpooling statistics. This project gave me the opportunity to learn and practice database management and SQL</p>

                <p>This project, which I used as a TIPE during my CPGE studies, involved creating a cryptosystem based on the discrete logarithm problem in Python. This cryptosystem also had to be tested, and for this I had to implement several computer attack techniques. As this was my first IT project, it allowed me to immerse myself in this domain and deepen my knowledge of Python</p>
