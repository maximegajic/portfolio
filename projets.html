                <h2>Movie Library <span class="tech-stack">React</span> </h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I decided to develop an website for a friend's father. The purpose of the website was to store all of his movie reviews, allowing users to search for movies based on various characteristics (genre, actors, etc.). I used React to develop this website, furthering the skills I had previously acquired in React Native </p>

                <p>Alongside my formation, I developed a personnal portfolio in HTLM. The goal is to have an equivalent of my resume, but as a website. I wanted to code in HTLM to fully understand the basics of what I had learned in React. It helped me in my next projects that required a web interface </p>

                <p>During my formation, I had the opportunity to develop an application. The goal of the application was to give the user a path from a place to another one, based on several criteria such as security, timeâ€¦ My task was to create a user interface for that purpose. We had to code in React Native and it was a new language for all of us. This project was my first interface, and it helped me get started with design development</p>

                <h2>Alpha-beta-based AI implementation <span class="tech-stack">Python/C</span>  </h2>
                <p>As projects during my formation, I created two autonomous players, of the Go and of the Amazon board games. The first was in Python and the other in C. Both included alpha-beta approaches and a board heuristic as a strategy. Other techniques, such as opening libraries, were also used. These projects gave me a first idea of the techniques used for artificial intelligence and allowed me to practice on them</p>

                <p>I was able to code a stand-alone board game in C. The aim of the project was to make the game more complex by adding rules, as the two players were predefined. This could range from new pieces with different moves to new game boards. This allowed me to get to grips with C with a project, and more precisely the use of headers</p>

                <p>This project, carried out during my training, involved creating and maintaining a database. The subject was school carpooling. All kinds of data had to be stored (proposed journeys, past journeys, etc.). We also had to check that the proposed journeys were coherent, and finally provide carpooling statistics. This project gave me the opportunity to learn and practice database management and SQL</p>

                <p>This project, which I used as an end of CPGE project, involved creating a cryptosystem based on the discrete logarithm problem in Python. This cryptosystem also had to be tested, and for this I had to implement several computer attack techniques. As this was my first IT project, it allowed me to immerse myself in this domain and deepen my knowledge of Python</p>
